# Draft Message to Kixx Maintainers

**Subject**: Community Documentation for Kixx Framework

---

Hi Kixx Team,

I've been building with Kixx and created comprehensive community documentation while working through real-world scenarios. The docs focus on conventions, gotchas, and patterns that I discovered weren't immediately obvious from exploring the code or existing documentation.

**Repository**: https://github.com/saouderkirk/kixx-community-docs

## What's Included

**Core Documentation:**
- **Agent Reference** - Quick reference specifically designed for AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- **Conventions** - File naming, routing rules, path mapping, configuration patterns
- **Troubleshooting** - Common errors with detailed solutions and explanations
- **How-To Guides** - Step-by-step guides including deployment (Railway, Render, VPS)

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Subdirectory structure requirement for non-root pages (a major gotcha!)
- Path mapping rules and index stripping behavior
- Template and routing conventions
- Production deployment configuration
- Common errors and their solutions

## Origin Story

The documentation was created while building a production application ([consultingfornormalpeople.com](https://consultingfornormalpeople.com)). Every convention and gotcha documented came from actual development experience - things that took time to figure out or caused bugs.

The docs were created collaboratively with AI coding assistants, which led to the "Agent Reference" - a quick-start guide specifically formatted for AI agents to understand Kixx quickly.

## How This Could Help

1. **Fills gaps** between official docs and real-world usage
2. **AI-friendly** format helps coding assistants work better with Kixx
3. **Community-driven** - open for contributions from other Kixx users
4. **Practical focus** - every example comes from solving real problems

## Proposed Integration Options

I'd love to contribute this to the Kixx ecosystem. Some possibilities:

**Option A**: Link from kixx.dev
- Add "Community Documentation" link in official docs
- Keeps official docs focused, community docs experimental

**Option B**: Incorporate into Official Docs
- Merge relevant sections into official documentation
- I'm happy to contribute via PR

**Option C**: Create "Community Guides" Section
- Official recognition as community resource
- Listed alongside official docs

**Option D**: No Action Needed
- Keep as independent resource
- Still helpful for community, just not officially linked

## What I Need From You

**Feedback on**:
- Would this be useful to link/include?
- Which integration approach works best?
- Any sections that conflict with official docs?
- Changes needed to align with Kixx vision?

**Optional**:
- Review for technical accuracy
- Suggestions for additional topics
- Guidance on contribution process

## Technical Details

- **Format**: Markdown (GitHub-friendly)
- **License**: CC BY 4.0 (open for community use)
- **Maintenance**: I'm committed to keeping it updated
- **Contributions**: Open to community PRs

## No Pressure

I built this because it helped me, and I thought it might help others. If it doesn't fit with official Kixx docs, that's totally fine - it'll still be useful as an independent community resource.

Thanks for building Kixx! It's been a joy to work with.

Best,
Simon Ouderkirk
